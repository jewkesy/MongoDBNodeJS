Suppose you have a collection of students of the following form:
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("50c598f582094fb5f92efb96"),
	"first_name" : "John",
	"last_name" : "Doe",
	"date_of_admission" : ISODate("2010-02-21T05:00:00Z"),
	"residence_hall" : "Fairweather",
	"has_car" : true,
	"student_id" : "2348023902",
	"current_classes" : [
		"His343",
		"Math234",
		"Phy123",
		"Art232"
	]
}

Now suppose that basic inserts into the collection, which only include the last name, first name and student_id, are too slow (we can't do enough of them per second from our program). What could potentially improve the speed of inserts. Check all that apply.

Remove all indexes from the collection
